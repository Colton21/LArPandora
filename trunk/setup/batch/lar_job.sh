# Executable script to run LArSoft jobs on condor/grid.
#
#   experiment - argoneut/uboone/lbne
#   testrel -    the LArSoft release the user wishes to process under
#   fclfile -    the fcl file that defines the job.  Should be located in the repository of the desired LArSoft release.
#   input   -    input fileset specifier
#   nevents -    # events to process
#
# Outputs:
#    At the end of the job all newly created ROOT and Log files will be copied to:
#    /grid/data/${experiment}/outstage/${user}/${cluster}_${process}
#    This does not include copies of any input files, which presumably live elsewhere already.

# Example usage:
# jobsub -N #segment lar_jobsubmit.sh -e argoneut -r development -f track.fcl -i file(s) -n 100
# This will run #segment Condor processes using the LArSoft job defined in "track.fcl", using the code in the development version of the repository, over input files contained in file(s).

This script defines the "lar" job to run on each segment of a Condor/Grid job.

REQUIRED:
   -e      Experiment name: argoneut or uboone or lbne.  
   -r      LArSoft release version.  
   -f      FCL file to use when running job. 
   -i      Input file(s) list.

OPTIONS:
   -h      Show this message
   -n      Number of events to process from each file in -i.  Default is all of them.
