# A script to run  framework (ART) jobs on the local cluster/grid.
#
# It takes 4 arguments, the latter two of which are specified. First two are inherited.:
#   cluster    - the condor job cluster number
#   process    - the condor job process number, within the cluster
#   user       - the username of the person who submitted the job
#   submitdir  - the directory from which the job was submitted ( not used at this time).
#
# Outputs:
#  - All output files are created in the grid scratch space.  At the end of the job
#    all files in this directory will be copied to:
#      /grid/data/uboone/outstage/$user/${cluster}_${process}
#    This includes a copy of the input files.
#
# Notes:
#
# 1) For documentation on using the grid, see
#      http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/fermigrid.shtm
#    For details on cpn and outstage see:
