# The -dOUT /lbne/data/users/echurch/ is some under-the-hood mojo
# that allows the grid/local nodes to write our output root files to CONDOR_DIR_OUT 
# living on the node itself (note the explicit wirting of such output to that dir in the 
# condor_lBdetMC.sh file), and then cpn over to the /lbne/data/users bluearc disks
# when the job has completed. 
# (cpn knows how to throttle the cp process so as not to clobber the bluearc disks).
