# A wrapper script for setup_larsoft_setup_fnal.sh.

# 24-Feb-10 B. Rebel adapt for fnal

# Here's the idea: setup_larsoft_setup_fnal.sh is a shell executable
# script.  When it is run, it returns the name of a temporary script
# that can be sourced to set the user's shell variables appropriately
# for the FNAL LArSoft installation.

# All this wrapper has to do is run the program, save the output, and
# source that output file.  The output file will automatically delete
# itself.

# Only execute this script if LArSoft has not already been set up (to
# prevent indefinite extension of $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH); note
# that this may cause problems if we want to switch release
# mid-session or something like that.
